Overview

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit for the distccd vulnerability identified as `CVE-2004-2687`. The vulnerability exists in the `distccd` daemon, which is part of the distcc distributed C/C++ compilation system. When improperly configured, `distccd` allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server without any authentication.
Vulnerability Details

distcc is designed to distribute compilation tasks across multiple machines to speed up the build process. However, if the distccd daemon is not properly secured, it exposes a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This occurs because the daemon listens on a network port and accepts commands from any client, allowing them to execute shell commands on the server as the user running the daemon.

The vulnerability has been assigned `CVE-2004-2687` and affects `distccd` versions prior to 3.1. When exploited, an attacker can gain shell access to the vulnerable machine, leading to potential compromise of the entire system.
